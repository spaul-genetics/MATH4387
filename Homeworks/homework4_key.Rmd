## Problem 1

Describe `UN11` data in the `alr4` package in your own words. You can get details using `?UN11` and googling things. Provide descriptive statistics and plots with your description. 



## Problem 2

Using the `UN11` data set in the `alr4` package:

a.	Fit a simple linear regression of $y=\log(\text{fertility})$ on $x$=`pctUrban`.

```{r}
data(UN11, package = 'alr4')
lm(log(fertility) ~ pctUrban, data = UN11)
```



b. 	Provide the equation for the fitted model.

$$\hat{E}(\log(\text{fertility})|\text{pctUrban}) = 1.5 - 0.01 \text{pctUrban}$$

c.	Use the model fit in a. to provide an interpretation of the association between `pctUrban` and `fertility` in the context of the problem.

For members of the United Nations, a 1 percent increase in the percentage of the population living in Urban regions is associated with an expected decrease in the number of children per woman by about 1% [the multiplicative effect is about $\exp(-0.01) \approx 0.99$].


## Problem 3


Fit the regression of $y=\log(\text{fertility})$ on $x_1 = \log(\text{ppgdp})$ and $x_2 = \text{lifeExpF}$. 

```{r}
lm(log(fertility) ~ log(ppgdp) + lifeExpF, data = UN11)
```

a.	What is the equation for the fitted model?


$$\hat{E}\left[\log(\text{fertility})|\text{ppgdp, lifeExpF}\right] = 3.5 - 0.065 \log(\text{ppgdp}) - 0.03(\text{lifeExpF})$$

b.	If we increase `ppgdp` by 25%, what is the expected decrease in fertility?  

The mean response should change by approximately a multiplicative effect of $\exp[-0.065\log 1.25]=1.25^{-0.065}=0.986$. Thus, the fertility changes by about 100(0.986-1) = -1.4%.

c.	Using your computation from part b (i.rbine., for a 25% increase in `ppgdp`), provide an interpretation of the association between `ppgdp` and `fertility` in the context of the problem.

For members of the United Nations, a 25% increase in the per capita gross domestic product in US dollars is associated with an expected decrease in the number of children per woman of about 1.4%, assuming average life expectancy doesnâ€™t change.
