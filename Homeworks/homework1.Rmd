## Problem 1

```{r include=F, echo=F, eval=F}
n = 1000
x1 = rnorm(n, mean = 3, sd = 2)
x2 = rnorm(n, mean = 7, sd = 3)
x3 = rnorm(n, mean = 3.5, sd = 2)
x4 = 5*rbeta(n, 1, 15)
y = -3 + 2*x1 + 3*x2 -x3/4 + x4 +rnorm(n,mean = 0, sd = 0.5)
dat = data.frame(pred1 = x1, pred2 = x2, pred3 = x3, pred4 = x4, response = y)
write.table(dat, './data/simu_hw1.txt', row.names = F, col.names = T, sep = '\t')
```

On canvas there is a data named `simu_hw1.txt` in the data folder. Download the data and read it in R using `read.table` function. 

* What are the names of the columns?
* Plot a boxplot of the `pred` variables. 
* Do all the `pred` variables look symmetric? Is it clear from the plot? If not what you can try to do to understand the `pred4` variable? Get a closer look on `pred4` variable. Does it look symmetric? 
* How would you compare the mean of the `pred` variable? (Are they somewhat equal or some variable has higher mean than other? You don't need to do any analysis. Just your comments on the boxplot.)
* Make a density plot of all the variables with clear legend. 


## Problem 2

* Using appropriate plot, comment on relationship between the `response` and other variables?

* Normalize (make mean = 0 and sd = 1) the `pred4` and plot densities of the original variable and the normalized version with legend. 

## Problem 3

Consider the joint distribution (pdf) of two random variables $X$ and $Y$, 

$$f(x, y) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}\pi} \exp \left[-\frac{2}{3}(x^2 - xy + y^2) \right]$$

* Find the marginal pdf: $f_x$ and $f_y$
* Find the expected values and variances of $X$ and $Y$
* Find the covariance between $X$ and $Y$. 
* (MATH 5387) Use R to get the probability of $P(-0.2\leq X<0.1)$?

## Problem 4 (MATH 5387)

Prove the identities. Here $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}$ are random vectors and $A$ is a matrix of constants. $A^T$ represents transpose of $A$. 

-	$E(A\mathbf{y})=AE(\mathbf{y})$
-	$E(\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{y})=E(\mathbf{x})+E(\mathbf{y})$
-	$var(A\mathbf{y})=A\ var(\mathbf{y}) A^T$
-	$cov(\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z})=cov(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})+cov(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z})$
-	$cov(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}+\mathbf{z})=cov(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})+cov(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})$
-	$cov(A\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=A\ cov(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\text{ and } cov(\mathbf{x},A\mathbf{y})=cov(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}) A^T.$
